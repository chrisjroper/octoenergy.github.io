This repo provides a simple Jekyll site for the octoenergy.github.io domain.

## Installation

You'll need a modern Ruby (>2.0) and bundler installed. For OSX, it's generally
easiest to use [rvm](https://rvm.io/).

Once those are in place, simply check out the repo and run

    $ bundle install

to install all Ruby dependencies. You can then run the local development server with:

    $ bundle exec jekyll server
