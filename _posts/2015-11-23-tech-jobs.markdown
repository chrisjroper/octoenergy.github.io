We're looking for super-smart people to join the tech team at Octopus Energy. We're in the process of designing and building our initial infrastructure. There are many difficult design problems to solve; we need creative, analytical minds who can help tame this notoriously tricky domain.  

To start with, our main technologies will be:

- AWS - using the excellent Hashicorp toolset (Vagrant, Packer, Consul and Terraform).
- Python - especially Django and Django-REST-Framework. We're also looking to employ Python's data processing libraries such as numpy and pandas (although this is still up for debate);
- Postgres and DynamoDB
- Memcached and Redis;
- React and related modules from the Javascript ecosystem - our consumer-facing user interfaces are going to be super slick;
- Node, npm, webpack, babel, gulp etc
- Puppet - for config management

Our current priorities lie with server-side work so we're keen to
speak to Pythonistas, developer data scientists or anyone with a love of automation and data processing.

But we're always interesting in talking to smart, motivated people with an
interest in green tech - we'd love to hear from anyone with experience in the
above. 

Could this be you?

We hope so. Ideally, you'll have experience in one or more of the following:

- Strong Python, especially Django and data processing libraries;
- Building slick user interfaces with React; 
- Knowledge of the modern Javascript ecosystem and asset build pipelines (eg
  webpack, mocha, gulp);
- Non-trivial experience with AWS;
- Experience working with 3rd party APIs, eg XML webservices, REST APIs, FTP
  filedrops, that kind of thing.

This is a great opportunity to be an early employee at a revolutionary company. Working at Octopus Energy offers the unique combination of solving difficult technical problems with modern technology as well as working on something that genuinely will make the world a better place.
