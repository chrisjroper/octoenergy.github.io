We're looking for smart people to join the tech team at Octopus Energy, to help
build out our initial set of infrastructure. To start with, our main
technologies will be:

- Python - particularly Django and data processing libraries like numpy or pandas;
- Postgres and Redis;
- React and related modules from the Javascript ecosystem;
- AWS - using the Hashicorp toolset (Vagrant, Packer, Consul and Terraform).

Our current priorities lie with server side work so we're keen to
speak to Pythonistas or anyone with a love of automation and data processing.
But we're always interesting in talking to smart, motivated people with an
interest in green tech - but we'd love to hear from anyone with experience in the
above. 

Could this be you?

We hope so. Ideally, you'll have experience in one or more of the following:

- Strong Python, especially Django and data processing libraries;
- Building slick user interfaces with React; 
- Knowledge of the modern Javascript ecosystem and asset build pipelines (eg
  webpack, mocha, gulp);
- Non-trivial experience with AWS;
- Experience working with 3rd party APIs, eg XML webservices, REST APIs, FTP
  filedrops, that kind of thing.

This is a great opportunity to be an early employee at a revolutionary company.
